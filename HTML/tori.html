					<h3>This is my son</h3>

					<!--Introduction  -->
					<img class="wrap" src="../images/greyson.jpg" alt="Greyson" width="200" height="200">
					<p class="offset"><span class="height">Me and my wife chose this name because we both really liked it. My wife
							chose
							the two middle
							names becasue she was named with two and felt that it was a good thing to have her kids named like her. Greyson
							is
							our only boy
							and he is without a doubt the sweetest boy a mom and dad could ask for. He loves video games and his favorite is
							<span class="red">Super Mario Odysey!</span> Greyson could sit in front of the television and play this game for
							hours on in.
							When Greyson is not consumed by video games, he loves to be the roughest kid possible (I take no blame for
							this)! He
							loves to
							wrestle with his Dad and his sisters on pretty much a non stop basis. With this said he is without a doubt one
							of
							the sweetest
							and kindest kids you'll ever meet!</span></p>

					<p class="important">Greyson's favorite superhero is <span class="red"><b>Spiderman</b>.</span></p>

					<!-- Nickname -->
					<h4 class="typewriter"><span id="booby">His nickname one day will need to be changed, but until that time he is
							called
							Booby Wooby.</span></h4>
					<p class="typewriter">This is Greyson's favorite song.</p>

					<p class="spacing">When the sun had left and the winter came<br>
						And the sky fall could only bring the rain<br>
						I sat in darkness, all broken hearted<br>
						I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone<br>
						I never meant to cry, started losing hope<br>
						But somehow baby, you broke through and saved me<br>
						You're an angel, tell me you're never leaving<br>
						'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in<br>
						You're holy, holy, holy, holy<br>
						I'm high on loving you, high on loving you<br>
						You're holy, holy, holy, holy<br>
						I'm high on loving you, high on loving you<br>
						You made the brightest days from the darkest nights<br>
						You're the river bank where I was baptized<br>
						Cleanse all the demons<br>
						That were killing my freedom<br>
						Let me lay you down, give me to ya<br>
						Get you singing babe, hallelujah<br>
						We'll be touching, we'll be touching heaven<br>
						You're an angel, tell me you're never leaving<br>
						'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in<br>
						You're holy, holy, holy, holy<br>
						I'm high on loving you, high on loving you<br>
						You're holy, holy, holy, holy<br>
						I'm high on loving you, high on loving you<br>
						I don't need the stars 'cause you shine for me<br>
						Like fire in my veins, you're my ecstasy<br>
						You're my ecstasy<br>
						You're holy, holy, holy, holy<br>
						I'm high on loving you, high on loving you<br>
						You're holy, holy, holy, holy<br>
						I'm high on loving you, high on loving you<br>
						You're the healing hands where it used to hurt<br>
						You're my saving grace, you're my kind of church<br>
						You're holy</p>
