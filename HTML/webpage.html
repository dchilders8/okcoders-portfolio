						<h5 class="mt-0">Tori Childers</h5>
						I met my wife one December night at Olive Garden. I remember when I walked into
						the door and saw her for the first time, I just knew this was going to be a one
						night date. She was absolutely stunning and I felt there was no way I was in her
						league and that I was lucky to even be there. We ordered our dinner and to this
						day I give her a hard time because she only ate 3 noodles. At the end of the night
						she seemed to have enjoyed herself and sure enough I was able to secure another
						date and eventually marriage.

				<!-- Greyson -->
				<div class="media">
					<div class="media-body">
						<h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Greyson Alexander Kade Childers</h5>
						Me and my wife chose this name because we both really liked it. My wife chose the
						two middle names becasue she was named with two and felt that it was a good thing
						to have her kids named like her. Greyson is our only boy and he is without a doubt
						the sweetest boy a mom and dad could ask for. He loves video games and his favorite is
						<span class="red">Super Mario Odysey!</span> Greyson could sit in front of the
						television and play this game for hours on in. When Greyson is not consumed by
						video games, he loves to be the roughest kid possible (I take no blame for this)!
						He loves to wrestle with his Dad and his sisters on pretty much a non stop basis.
						With this said he is without a doubt one of the sweetest and kindest kids you'll
						ever meet!

					<div class="media-body">
						<h5 class="mt-0">Gabrielle Sophia Elyse Childers</h5>
						Gabby is our 7 year old little girl who is quickly growing up on us. She is a big
						helper around our house, and loves to play with her American Girl dolls. Gabby can
						be a bit sassy at times but overall she is a sweet little girl who mom and dad
						loves very much. Gabby will be entering the 2nd grade this year and we know she's
						excited to be moving on. Gabby's favorite thing to do is kick it with her Gram's!
						Gabby loves to go over there and swim in her pool, go on what seem to be endless
						shopping spree's and the countless lunch dates Grammy has with everybody.
						Yep, Gabby and Grammy are two peas in a pod to say the least!</p>

				<!-- Olivia           -->
				<div class="media">
					<div class="media-body">
						<h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Olivia Madeline Grace Childers</h5>
						Oliva is our special little girl. Olivia was born several weeks early due to some
						pregnancy complications with her momma. I'll never forget the night when what seemed
						to be a SWAT team rushed into our hospital room and took my wife away in a blink
						of an eye. I remember shortly after the doctors walking in and telling me to put a
						gown on. Afterwards they escorted me to this other room and as they was doing so I
						saw a baby crying on a table with nurses all around her. The nurse who was escorting
						me asked me if I wanted to hold my little girl. With a puzzled look on my face I asked
						her what she was talking about. The nurse explained that the little girl lying on the
						table crying was in fact my daughter! Needless to say from that point on she has just
						been the most amazing little girl and I wouldn't trade the experiances away for
						anything.</p>

					<div class="media-body">
						<h5 class="mt-0">Lilly-Ann Love Childers</h5>
						Lilly our oldest daughter and is 9 years old. Lilly is a very quiet and without a
						doubt the shyest of the bunch (she gets that from her dad). Lilly splits time between
						her moms house and our house. Lilly loves to play sports and currently plays softball
						and basketball. When Lilly was born she was a CHUNKY MONKEY let me tell you. Lilly
						was almost like a rolly polly when it came to her body type, but like all kids do
						she began to fill out and grow vertically and is now a pretty tall little girl.
						Lilly is a very sweet minded girl whom Daddy loves very much. I can't wait to watch
						her grow up and to see what the future holds for her!</p>
